        <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
        <h4 class="project-description-inner-h4">Neurodiversity Definitions</h4>
        <p><strong>Neurodiversity: </strong>The diversity of human minds, the infinite variation in neurocognitive functioning within our species.
          <a href="./curriculum.html#citations">[1]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Neurodivergent/Neurodivergence: </strong>Neurodivergent, means having a mind that functions in ways which diverge significantly from the dominant societal standards of “normal.”
          Neurodivergent is quite a broad term. Neurodivergence (the state of being neurodivergent) can be largely or entirely genetic and innate, or it can be largely or entirely produced by brain-altering experience, or some combination of the two. Autism and dyslexia are examples of innate forms of neurodivergence, while alterations in brain functioning caused by such things as trauma, long-term meditation practice, or heavy usage of psychedelic drugs are examples of forms of neurodivergence produced through experience.
        <a href="./curriculum.html#citations">[1]</a>
      </p>

        <p><strong>Neurotypical: </strong>means having a style of neurocognitive functioning that falls within the dominant societal standards of “normal.”

          Neurotypical can be used as either an adjective (“He’s neurotypical”) or a noun (“He’s a neurotypical”).
          
          Neurotypical is the opposite of neurodivergent. Neurotypicality is the way-of-being from which neurodivergent people diverge.
          <a href="./curriculum.html#citations">[1]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Neurodiverse: </strong>A group of people is neurodiverse if one or more members of the group differ substantially from other members, in terms of their neurocognitive functioning.

          Or, to phrase it another way, a neurodiverse group is a group in which multiple neurocognitive styles are represented.There is no such thing as a “neurodiverse individual.” The correct term is “neurodivergent individual.” An individual can diverge, but an individual cannot be diverse.

          Neurodiverse does not mean “non-neurotypical.” The opposite of neurotypical is neurodivergent, not neurodiverse. Neurodiverse cannot be used to mean “non-neurotypical,” because neurotypical people, like all other human beings, are part of the spectrum of human neurodiversity.

        <h4 class="project-description-inner-h4">Music/Technology Definitions</h4>
        <p><strong>Volume: </strong>The output loudness of a system.</p>
        <p><strong>Threshold: </strong>The point at which an event occurs. The point at which a sound plays or an effect is engaged.</p>
        <p><strong>Sensitivity: </strong>How reactive the instrument is to motion or movement.</p>
        <p><strong>Grain: </strong>When a complete sound is separated into many slices, a grain is one of those slices. Number of grains refers to how many slices a sound is split into. Size of grains refers to how long those slices are; if they are short and percussive or long and overlapping. Pitch of grain refers to if the grain sounds higher or lower than its original sound. Randomness of the grains adds organic features in order to sound richer.</p>
        <p><strong>Probability: </strong>The extent to which an event is likely to occur.</p>
        <p><strong>Transport Tempo: </strong>Determines how quickly or slowly instruments play.</p>
        <p><strong>Filter: </strong>The thing that changes the timbre of a sound by removing high frequency content (low-pass filter), or by removing low-frequency content (high-pass filter). The filter in Wearable Jazz is a dual state DJ filter which is a low-pass filter if turned one way and a high-pass filter if turned the other way.</p>
        <p><strong>Echo: </strong>Repetitions of a sound reflecting back.</p>
        <p><strong>Glitch: </strong>In Wearable Jazz, 'gltch' freezes a moment of audio and repeats it. In music production, glitch effects are usually anything that takes a sound source and alters it beyond recognition based on a variety of manipulation techniques (e.g. filters or grains). </p>
        <p><strong>Wearable Music Sensor: </strong>This is a wearable sensor device that tracks accelerometer and gyroscopic motion along the x, y, and z-axis.</p>
        <p><strong>Accelerometer: </strong>An instrument that measures vibration or acceleration of motion.</p>
        <p><strong>Gyroscope: </strong>A gyroscope is like a super-fast spinning top. When it's spinning, it really doesn't want to change how it's pointing. So, if you give it a nudge, it pushes back!

          People use this special spinning gadget in all sorts of things, from fun toys to big machines like airplanes and spaceships. It helps them figure out which way is up and which way is down, even when they're doing tricky twists and turns.</p>
        <p><strong>X, Y, and Z axis: </strong>An XYZ axis is a set of three lines that help us describe positions in space.
          The X-axis is horizontal and runs from left to right.
          The Y-axis is vertical and runs from bottom to top.
          The Z-axis is perpendicular to the XY plane and runs from front to back.
          Together, they give us a way to locate points or objects in a 3D space, like in a video game or in geometry.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Computational Thinking: </strong> A way of breaking big problems into smaller, manageable steps, just like when you solve a puzzle or follow a recipe. You think logically and come up with a plan to solve a problem, and then use a computer to carry out that plan. It's like being a computational detective, figuring out the best way to tackle a challenge!</p>
        <p><strong>Decomposition: </strong>Taking a big task or problem and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Allows you to divide a task it into smaller parts to work on one at a time. This way, it doesn't feel overwhelming, and you can focus on doing a well on each piece.</p>
        <p><strong>Input: </strong>Information and data that goes into a system, affecting how the system interacts and what outputs it produces.</p>
        <p><strong>Outputs: </strong>the results or things that come out of a process or activity. It's what you get at the end after you've done something. For example, if you're baking cookies, the cookies themselves are the outputs and the ingredients are the inputs!</p>
        <p><strong>Pattern: </strong>A recognizable and repeatable sequence. Like seeing the same shapes or symbols in a quilt, or familiar beats in your favorite songs. Patterns help us quickly recognize and understand large chunks of information.</p>
        <p><strong>Beat: </strong>The smallest part of a musical idea or phrase that is still felt. The pulse that drvies the music. Usually the beat is what you dance to.</p>
        <p><strong>Measure: </strong>Akin to a 'musical sentence'. A small, organized component of a larger piece of music that has a specific number of beats. </p>
