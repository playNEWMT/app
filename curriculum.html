        <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
        <h4 class="project-description-inner-h4">Neurodiversity Definitions</h4>
        <p><strong>Neurodiversity: </strong>The diversity of human minds, the infinite variation in neurocognitive functioning within our species.
          <a href="./curriculum.html#citations">[1]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Neurodivergent/Neurodivergence: </strong>Neurodivergent, means having a mind that functions in ways which diverge significantly from the dominant societal standards of “normal.”
          Neurodivergent is quite a broad term. Neurodivergence (the state of being neurodivergent) can be largely or entirely genetic and innate, or it can be largely or entirely produced by brain-altering experience, or some combination of the two. Autism and dyslexia are examples of innate forms of neurodivergence, while alterations in brain functioning caused by such things as trauma, long-term meditation practice, or heavy usage of psychedelic drugs are examples of forms of neurodivergence produced through experience.
        <a href="./curriculum.html#citations">[1]</a>
      </p>

        <p><strong>Neurotypical: </strong>means having a style of neurocognitive functioning that falls within the dominant societal standards of “normal.”

          Neurotypical can be used as either an adjective (“He’s neurotypical”) or a noun (“He’s a neurotypical”).
          
          Neurotypical is the opposite of neurodivergent. Neurotypicality is the way-of-being from which neurodivergent people diverge.
          <a href="./curriculum.html#citations">[1]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Neurodiverse: </strong>A group of people is neurodiverse if one or more members of the group differ substantially from other members, in terms of their neurocognitive functioning.

          Or, to phrase it another way, a neurodiverse group is a group in which multiple neurocognitive styles are represented.There is no such thing as a “neurodiverse individual.” The correct term is “neurodivergent individual.” An individual can diverge, but an individual cannot be diverse.

          Neurodiverse does not mean “non-neurotypical.” The opposite of neurotypical is neurodivergent, not neurodiverse. Neurodiverse cannot be used to mean “non-neurotypical,” because neurotypical people, like all other human beings, are part of the spectrum of human neurodiversity.

        <h4 class="project-description-inner-h4">Music/Technology Definitions</h4>
        <p><strong>Volume: </strong>The output loudness of a system.</p>
        <p><strong>Threshold: </strong>The point at which an event occurs. The point at which a sound plays or an effect is engaged</p>
        <p><strong>Sensitivity: </strong>How reactive the instrument is to motion or movement.</p>
        <p><strong>Grain: </strong>When a complate sound is separated into many slices, a grain is one of those slices. Number of grains refers to how many slices a sound is slpit into. Size of grains refers to how long those slices are; if they are short and percussive or long and overlapping. Pitch of grain refers to if the grain sounds higher or lower than its original sound. Randomness of the grains adds organic features in order to sound richer.</p>
        <p><strong>Probability: </strong>The extent to which an event is likely to occur.</p>
        <p><strong>Transport Tempo: </strong>Determines how quickly of slowly instruments play.</p>
        <p><strong>Filter: </strong>Something changes the tambre of a sound by removing high frequency content (low-pass filter), or by removing low-frequency content (high-pass filter). The filter in Wearable Jazz is a dual state DJ filter which is a low-pass filter if turned on way and a high-pass filter if turned the other way.</p>
        <p><strong>Echo: </strong>Repetitions of a sound reflecting back.</p>
        <p><strong>Glitch: </strong>In Wearable Jazz, 'gltch' freezes a moment of audio and repeats it. In music production glitch effects are usually anything that take a sound source and alter it beyond recognition based on a variety of manipulation techniques (e.g. filters or grains). </p>
        <p><strong>Wearable Music Sensor: </strong>This is a wearable sensor device that tracks accelerometer and gyroscopic motion along the x, y, and z-axis.</p>
        <p><strong>Accelerometer: </strong>An instrument that measures vibration or acceleration of motion.</p>
        <p><strong>Gyroscope: </strong>A gyroscope is like a super-fast spinning top. When it's spinning, it really doesn't want to change how it's pointing. So, if you give it a nudge, it pushes back!

          People use this special spinning gadget in all sorts of things, from fun toys to big machines like airplanes and spaceships. It helps them figure out which way is up and which way is down, even when they're doing tricky twists and turns.</p>
        <p><strong>X, Y, and Z axis: </strong>An XYZ axis is a set of three lines that help us describe positions in space.
          The X-axis is horizontal and runs from left to right.
          The Y-axis is vertical and runs from bottom to top.
          The Z-axis is perpendicular to the XY plane and runs from front to back.
          Together, they give us a way to locate points or objects in a 3D space, like in a video game or in geometry.
