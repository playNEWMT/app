        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          Students with disabilities, particularly those with autism, experience unequal outcomes in STEM education and employment. Despite frequently reported strengths and interests in STEM disciplines, individuals with autism often do not receive the support—those related to communication, transitions, and flexibility—needed to succeed. The Neurodiversity Education Research Center and Arizona State University Research Practice Partnership (RPP) is co-designing curriculum, neurodiverse pedagogies, and wearable music technology for use with neurodiverse middle-schoolers, including students with autism labels. In working with teachers, parents, and employers, this project will create pathways to position students with autism spectrum disorder for success in school and also the larger community.
        </br>
          This is a three-year project funded by an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2122924" target="_blank">NSF Computer Science for All grant.</a>
          </p>
          
          <h4 class="project-description-inner-h4">First Year 2021-2022</h4>
          <p>
          During four workshops, a pilot group of experienced teachers of neurodivergent middle school students (Teacher Fellows), alongside teacher educators and experts in computer science, media studies, and the arts, explored the potential of custom designed, wearable musical instruments to embed and teach computational thinking concepts to neurodiverse middle school students. Teacher Fellows piloted the various iterations in their classrooms and received feedback from their students. Central to this work was the building, playing, and performing of wearable digital musical instruments and CT activities.
          </p>
          
          <h4 class="project-description-inner-h4">Second Year 2022-2023</h4>
          <p>
          Teacher Fellows and the ASU research team co-designed and refined devices and apps while developing a set of four CT lesson kits. Each kit included a full lesson and ideas for extensions, expansions across content areas, and adapations. Lessons also included notes on how to develop neurodiverse workplace skills. Teacher Fellows introduced lessons to teachers and middle school students through interactive demonstrations at a culminating event called <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/neurodiversity-steam-fest-tickets-629367383787" target="_blank">Neurodiversity STEAM Fest</a>, 
          hosted at ASU's Tempe campus.
          </p>
          
          <h4 class="project-description-inner-h4">Third Year 2023-2024</h4>
          <p>
          The research team is currently seeking 25 middle school teachers to participate in a series of six Teacher Fellow-led workshops. Teacher Fellows will introduce the co-designed curriculum during the workshops and the research team will support teacher implementation in their classrooms. Check out events calendar for workshop dates.

          </br>
          </br>
          The research team is also currently seeking employers who are interested in learning more about the neurodiversity paradigm, neurodivergent employee talent development, and supporting neurodivergence in the workplace. Interested employers would participate in 5 contact hours of research-related activities.
          An informational webinar is scheduled for Friday, November 3, 2023. You can see event details with registration link in the events calendar.
